<!-- 79) create a para with dummy content & hide this para using display & visibility property ( note down the diff between none & hidden value) -->

<!-- The difference between display: none; and visibility: hidden; is that when an element is set to display: none;, it is completely removed 
from the layout, including its space, and any other elements can occupy its position. Whereas, when an element is set to visibility: 
hidden;, it is still rendered in the layout, but it's invisible and takes up space as if it were visible. -->
